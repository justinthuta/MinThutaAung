# 👋 Hi, I'm Min Thuta Aung

## 💻 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science student at Queens College** (CUNY) with a passion for **Data Engineering**, **Machine Learning**, and building real-world tools that solve problems. I'm actively working on developing my skills in **Java**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

I enjoy applying algorithmic thinking and systems design to create scalable and efficient applications — and I'm always seeking to learn new technologies and frameworks.
